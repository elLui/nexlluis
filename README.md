# Welcome to elluis.codes! 🎉

This is a Next.js project, ready to take your website to the next level! Or, you know, not. 🤷‍♂️

## Getting Started

Let's do this thing! 💪

:::info

npm run dev

or
yarn dev

or
pnpm dev

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and brace yourself for mediocrity. 🤨

You can play around with the site by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page updates in real-time, because who wants to wait for anything in this fast-paced world, right? 💨

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`. Why settle for just a mediocre website when you can have broken API routes too? 🤔

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages. Because who needs well-designed pages when you have functional API routes? 🙃

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization
